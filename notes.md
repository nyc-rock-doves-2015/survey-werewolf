# Review Notes

## Experience

Solid app that does what it ought

##  db

* no constraints on User?
* why is create_users executable?

## Hygiene

* `test.css` file
* `_survey-card.erb`
* `.gitignore`
  * This file will let you ignore a directory..it'd be nice to ignore your
    open-uri stuff

## WTF

Why do we have `bower-componenets` seems like there might be some
over-engineering afoot?

## SASS

There's a huge amount of styling work done on this app.  I think I'd prefer to
see a cleaner app versus these features.

`git diff c8ab43fcd8b...8ed906995b --shortstat`
